# Installation and configuration of Active directory

## What is Active directory?

As defined by Microsoft, "A directory is a hierarchical structure that stores information about objects on the network. A directory service, such as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), provides the methods for storing directory data and making this data available to network users and administrators".

I don't want to take more time to talk about the AD DS concepts because there are a lot of ressources on the internet where you can get all the informations you neeed. I just leave this link from the Microsoft website, which i think explained very well all of the concepts:
