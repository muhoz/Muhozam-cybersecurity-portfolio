# Setting-up Hyper-V in Windows 10/11
I was a client of VMWare and Virtual Box but after discovering Hyper-V and try it, i prefer to use this solution as an Hypervisor for my VMs.

So to install it (better say activate it), you can :
- On your search bar, you can enter "Features" and this will be shown
<img width="554" alt="features" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06e63bcc-66d9-444f-ac3a-61573237e7bf">


- After this window will shown, scroll till you find Hyper V and check all the box related


- Your computer will restart and you will be able to find "Hyper V Manager" by entering it on the search bar.

- Click on it and the manager will show itself
